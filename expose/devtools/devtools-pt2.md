1. What was the bug?  
Num1 and Num2 are string, when you do + in calculateSum, you just append two strings and that will not give you the corrrect answer.  
2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)  
Convert the type of num1 and num2 to number. When you do + in calculateSum, it just add two numbers and return the correct result.
