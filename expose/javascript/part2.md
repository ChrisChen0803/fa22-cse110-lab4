### Question 1
Ans: 3. The value of i: 0->1->2->3. When i=3, i is not less than prices.length(which is 3) so loop ends.
### Question 2
Ans: 150.discountedPrice will be updated in every loop. In the last loop, we have 300*(1-50%) = 150.
### Question 3
Ans: 150. discountedPrice integer, this line will not change its value. Therefore, finalPrice is 150.
### Question 4
Ans: It is an array that record the finalPrices, which is 100*50%=50,200*50%=100,300*50%=150.
### Question 5
ReferenceError: i is not defined.
### Question 6
ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined
### Question 7
Ans: 150. discountedPrice integer, this line will not change its value. Therefore, finalPrice is 150. Because we use discountedPrice in the block scope, this will not cause any errors.
### Question 8
Ans: It is an array that record the finalPrices, which is 100*50%=50,200*50%=100,300*50%=150. Because we use discountedPrice in the block scope, this will not cause any errors.
### Question 9
ReferenceError: i is not defined.
### Question 10
Ans: 3. const length is 3, this will not change.
### Question 11
Ans: It is an array that record the finalPrices, which is 100*50%=50,200*50%=100,300*50%=150.
